## Overview
kdensity is an implementation of univariate kernel density estimation with support for parametric starts and asymmetric kernels. Its main function is `kdensity`, which is has approximately the same syntax as `stats::density`. Its new functionality is:

* `kdensity` has built-in support for many *parametric starts*, such as `normal` and `gamma`, but you can also supply your own. 
*  It supports several asymmetric kernels ones such as `gcopula` and `gamma` kernels, but also the common symmetric ones. In addition, you can also supply your own kernels. 
* A selection of choices for the bandwidth function `bw`, again including an option to specify your own.
* The returned value is callable: The density estimator returns a density function when called.

A reason to use `kdensity` is to avoid *boundary bias* when estimating densities on the unit interval or the positive half-line. Asymmetric kernels such as `gamma` and `gcopula` are designed for this purpose. The support for parametric starts allows you to easily use a method that is often superior to ordinary kernel density estimation.

## Installation
From inside `R`, use one of the following commands:
```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# For the CRAN release
install.packages("kdensity")
# For the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JonasMoss/kdensity")
```

Call the `library` function and use it just like `stats:density`, but with optional additional arguments.
```{r simpleuse, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library("kdensity")
plot(kdensity(mtcars$mpg, start = "normal"))
```

## Description

Kernel density estimation with a *parametric start* was introduced by Hjort and Glad in [Nonparametric Density Estimation with a Parametric Start (1995)](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176324627). The idea is to start out with a parametric density before you do your kernel density estimation, so that your actual kernel density estimation will be a correction to the original parametric estimate. This is a good idea because the resulting estimator will be better than an ordinary kernel density estimator whenever the true density is close to your suggestion; and the estimator can be superior to the ordinary kernal density estimator even when the suggestion is pretty far off.

In addition to parametric starts, the package implements some *asymmetric kernels*. These kernels are useful when modelling data with sharp boundaries, such as data supported on the positive half-line or the unit interval. Currently we support the following asymmetric kernels:

* Jones and Henderson's *Gaussian copula KDE*, from [Kernel-Type Density Estimation on the Unit Interval (2007)](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/94/4/977/246269). This is used for data on the unit interval. The bandwidth selection mechanism described in that paper is implemented as well. This kernel is called `gcopula`.

* Chen's two *beta kernels* from [Beta kernel estimators for density functions (1999)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947399000109). These are used for data supported on the on the unit interval, and are called `beta` and `beta_biased`.

* Chen's two *gamma kernels* from [Probability Density Function Estimation Using Gamma Kernels (2000)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1004165218295). These are used for data supported on the positive half-line, and are called `gamma` and `gamma_biased`.

These features can be combined to make asymmetric kernel densities estimators with parametric starts, see the example below. The package contains only one function, `kdensity`, in addition to the generics `plot`, `points`, `lines`, `summary`, and `print`. 

## Usage

The function `kdensity` takes some `data`, a kernel `kernel` and a parametric start `start`. You can optionally specify the `support` parameter, which is used to find the normalizing constant.

The following example uses the \code{airquality} data set plots both a gamma-kernel density estimate with a gamma start (black) and the the fully parametric gamma density. The underlying parameter estimates are always maximum likelood.

```{r example, echo = TRUE}
library("kdensity")
kde = kdensity(airquality$Wind, start = "gamma", kernel = "gamma")
plot(kde, main = "Wind speed (mph)")
lines(kde, plot_start = TRUE, col = "red")
rug(airquality$Wind)
```

Since the return value of `kdensity` is a function, it is callable, as in:

```{r callable, echo = TRUE}
kde(10)
```

You can access the parameter estimates by using `coef`. You can also access the log likelihood (`logLik`), AIC and BIC of the parametric start distribution.

```{r dollar, echo = TRUE}
coef(kde)
logLik(kde)
AIC(kde)
```
